<image:title>Open daily 8am-sunset. This utopian community of 200 which believed the entire universe existed within a giant, hollow sphere relocated from New York to Florida in 1894. The Koreshans built and operated a printing facility, boat works, cement works, sawmill, bakery, store and hostelry. Education, science and art also helped shape their community. After their leader's death in 1908, membership declined. In 1961, the remaining members deeded 305 acres of their land to the state of Florida as a park and memorial. The Koreshan Unity Settlement Historic District is on the National Register of Historic Places. Guided tours available.</image:title>
